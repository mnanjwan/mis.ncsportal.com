### Testing Notifications

#### In-App Notifications
1. Login as a user who should receive notifications
2. Look for the notification bell icon in the header
3. Click to view unread notifications
4. Verify notifications appear for relevant actions

#### Email Notifications
1. Ensure mail configuration is set in `.env`:
   ```
   MAIL_MAILER=smtp
   MAIL_HOST=your-smtp-host
   MAIL_PORT=587
   MAIL_USERNAME=your-username
   MAIL_PASSWORD=your-password
   MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=noreply@ncs.gov.ng
   ```
2. Run queue worker (if using queued emails):
   ```bash
   php artisan queue:work
   ```
3. Perform actions and check recipient email inbox

#### Notification Test Checklist

**Procurement Notifications:**
- [ ] Submit procurement → Comptroller Pharmacy receives notification
- [ ] Approve procurement → Creator + Central Store receive notifications
- [ ] Reject procurement → Creator receives notification
- [ ] Receive procurement → Creator receives notification

**Requisition Notifications:**

### Viewing Notifications in Database

```sql
-- View recent pharmacy notifications
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE notification_type LIKE 'pharmacy_%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 20;

-- View notifications for specific user
SELECT * FROM notifications 
WHERE user_id = [USER_ID] 
AND notification_type LIKE 'pharmacy_%' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No drugs available" message
- Drugs are added to catalog when:
  1. Comptroller Pharmacy/Central Medical Store adds them manually
  2. Procurements are received (auto-creates drugs)
- Run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=PharmacySeeder`

### "You are not assigned to any command"
- Command Pharmacist must have a `command_id` in their role assignment
- Check user_roles pivot table

### Empty dashboards
- Run seeder: `php artisan db:seed --class=PharmacySeeder`
- Check user has correct role assigned

### Sidebar not visible
- Ensure user has one of: Comptroller Procurement, Comptroller Pharmacy, Central Medical Store, Command Pharmacist roles
- Clear cache: `php artisan cache:clear && php artisan view:clear`

---

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Run seeder to populate test data
php artisan db:seed --class=PharmacySeeder

# Clear all caches
php artisan cache:clear && php artisan config:clear && php artisan view:clear && php artisan route:clear

# Start development server
php artisan serve

# Check routes
php artisan route:list --name=pharmacy
```

**Happy Testing!** 🎉
